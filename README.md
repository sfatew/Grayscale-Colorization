# Grayscale-Colorization
Colorize grayscale image (Project 2 - HUST)

To run the demo, first create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

 **Install dependencies**:
    (Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the project root directory)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply go to this drive: 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iDNwooaIGfxeb335f40Z78Ov89D9JRXR


Download the models from there, create a `model` folder in the poject root directory an put them in there.

After that you can run the Infer.py file and follow what it told to run the file  
Note that you can also run each file in the 'infer' folder seperately and dont have to use Infer.py if you dont want to

**Note** we recommend always using usage 'test' even with a grayscale image
